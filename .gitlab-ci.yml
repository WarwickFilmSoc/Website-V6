# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages
#
# You can copy and paste this template into a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
# You should not add this template to an existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file by using the `include:` keyword.
