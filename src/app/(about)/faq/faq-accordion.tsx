          WSC is one of the largest societies on campus and is a cinema run by
          students, for the members and guests of the University of Warwick.
          Since we were founded back in 1973, we’ve been showing a wide variety
          of films – from Hollywood blockbusters to the more obscure artistic
          films that didn&apos;t get the cinema release they deserved, as well
          as the classics that you want to see again.
