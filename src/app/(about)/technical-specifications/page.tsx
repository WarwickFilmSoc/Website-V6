      <h2>Sight&hellip;</h2>

      <p>
        The first thing you should know about Warwick Student Cinema is that we
        do not show DVDs, Blu-rays or any other home cinema format media to our
        audience in L3. Only industry standard equipment is used; this means
        either showing either real film &ndash; both 35mm and 70mm &ndash; or
        DCI compliant digitally-projected movies.
      </p>

      <h3>35mm and 70mm Film</h3>

      <p>
        Unlike many other cinemas &ndash; even those still able to show 35mm or
        70mm film &ndash; Warwick Student Cinema usually uses a changeover
        system when running shows from these formats, in which two projectors
        are used alternately. Films are transported on spools of about twenty
        minutes each. A typical feature will have six or seven reels. One reel
        is played on the first projector and at the right moment at the end of
        this reel, we switch over to the second projector and so on. This moment
        is indicated by marks on the film (as made famous in <i>Fight Club</i>!)
        known as &lsquo;cue dots&rsquo;, which appear in the top right hand
        corner of the image. There are two sets of dots; the first is
        approximately eight seconds before the end of the reel and indicates to
        the projectionist when to start the film moving through the second
        projector. The second set, about seven seconds later, signals the time
        to shut off the first projector and begin showing the next reel of film.
        This results in an almost seamless changover that you, the audience,
        should not notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only are we able to project standard 35mm film, but also our
        projectors are capable of handling 70mm film. We are the only student
        cinema in the country capable of showing 70mm and one of only a handful
        of cinemas in the UK who show 70mm film on a regular basis. This
        provides an improved picture due to two reasons: firstly, the film is
        often in better condition than a 35mm print &ndash; as it will have been
        played far less &ndash; and secondly, because the film is larger,
        meaning the image is magnified less than 35mm.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Platter System</h3>

      <p>
        Warwick Student Cinema is also able to operate with a long play system.
        This involves, in our case, a platter which was kindly given to us on
        permanent loan by the
        <a href="http://www.ppttrust.org/">Projected Picture Trust</a> in 2002.
        The platter consists of three giant plates, each approximately 54 inches
        in diameter. The entire film is spliced together and placed on one of
        the plates. The film then makes its way to one of our Victoria 8
        projectors (from which it is projected on screen) via a circuitous route
        using a series of rollers, before going back to one of the other plates.
        This is particularly useful in the event of one of the projectors
        failing, an event which previously would have resulted in the
        cancellation of the film. Also, unlike any other playing system, films
        can immediately be shown again due to the fact that the film uptake is
        from the inside of the reel.
      </p>

      <h3>Digital Cinema</h3>

      <p>
        Our society is also lucky enough to have installed the first 4K RGB
        laser projector in Coventry and Warwickshire, in February 2020. Unlike
        traditional cinema projectors (both digital and film), its light source
        comprises red, green and blue laser modules instead of a xenon arc lamp.
        This cutting-edge illumination technology facilitates superior black
        levels as well as a wider colour gamut to provide the best picture
        possible. The 4K resolution provides a four-fold increase in picture
        detail compared to standard 2K systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The digital projector &ndash; a Barco SP4k-15 &ndash; is adapted for use
        with its B-mount high contrast lens and has an ICMP-X installed, which
        combines the roles of a digital cinema server and alternative content
        processing (such as the pre-film slideshow). Naturally, our digital
        projector does not operate using a changeover system as there are no
        reels of film to change over. Instead, the film arrives at the cinema on
        a hard drive, or is transfered electronically onto one of our film
        transit servers. The film, stored in a format known as DCP, is then
        &lsquo;ingested&rsquo; (uploaded) to the digital projector server; this
        takes about three-quarters of the time taken to play the whole of the
        film. A playlist on the server is then created, which includes
        auditorium automation (lights, moveable screen masking etc.), pre-film
        trailers and &ndash; of course &ndash; the feature film. This automation
        takes a lot of pressure off of the projectionist on the night!
      </p>

      <h2>&hellip;and Sound</h2>

      <p>
        The picture is only half of the cinema experience, the other being the
        sound. Warwick Student Cinema can play up to 5.1 surround; left, centre
        and right channels provide precise and clear positioning of dialogue,
        separate left and right surround channels help provide the feeling of
        immersion in the sound and give general atmosphere and finally a
        subwoofer/bass effects channel produces extra strong bass sounds which
        are particularly audible in action and special effects sequences. All
        our amplifiers are THX certified, as are our surround and subwoofer
        speakers. Our left, right and centre loudspeaker stacks are not an
        off-the-shelf system and were custom assembled from components by WSC
        (carefully chosen to best work with the space in L3) and so have no
        manufacturer THX certification as a whole, but only high-quality
        components specified elsewhere in THX-certified systems are used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Digital films all have a standard LPCM sound format, which is entirely
        uncompressed and lossless in order to give the highest quality audio
        possible. From film, we are capable of playing all industry-standard
        sound formats; this includes all three major digital systems &ndash;
        Dolby Digital, Digital Theatre Systems (DTS) and Sony Dynamic Digital
        Sound (SDDS) &ndash; as well as the older analogue formats. Analogue
        sound on 35mm film is usually recorded optically and comprises the
        single-channel mono format as well as the stereo and analogue surround
        sound Dolby A and Dolby SR formats. 70mm film is presented with either
        fantastic six-channel Dolby magnetic sound or crystal-clear DTS digital
        sound. Magnetic sound on 35mm is rare &ndash; but we can play it if the
        need arises!
      </p>

      <p>
        When showing either 35mm or 70mm film, the sound readers pick up the
        information on the film print and send this to the relevant processor.
        For most formats this is the CP500, which can decode mono, Dolby A,
        Dolby SR and Dolby Digital sound &ndash; all of which share a combined
        reader built into to the Victoria 8 projectors. The DTS and SDDS systems
        both consist of separate readers (which are bolted onto the projectors
        as required) and processors.
      </p>

      <p>
        All sound is fed into our AP20 sound processor; when projecting film
        this will come from the relevant film sound processor and for digital
        shows this will come straight from the digital cinema server. The AP20
        allows us to make adjustments to volume etc. and the Dirac Live 2.0
        processing specially optimises the audio based on measurements of how
        sound behaves in L3, ensuring that all of our shows sound as good as can
        be. After processing, each channel of output goes into its own
        amplifier, which together provide more than enough power to drive all of
        the speakers around the auditorium.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is not just a crisp picture and clear sound that makes projection
        at Warwick Student Cinema what it is today. All of this equipment would
        be useless if it were not for the steady stream of dedicated technicians
        who maintain the equipment and for the projectionists who run it. These
        people all give up their time to first be trained and then, in turn,
        take on the task of training subsequent generations.
