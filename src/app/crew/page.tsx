      <h1>Crew</h1>
      <p>All Warwick Students and Staff are welcome to Get Involved!</p>
      <p>
        Interested in being more active within WSC? Learning new skills? Meeting
        new people? Discovering the art of running a cinema? Being part of the
        biggest society on campus? Or just want&nbsp;
        <b>free films for you and a guest</b>? There&apos;s a role for you with
        us! For more information, you can always email the exec, or speak to a
        member of crew at any screening.
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of Warwick Student Cinema and the quality of service we are
        able to provide for our members is entirely down to members of the Crew
        who volunteer their time to help run every single show, and look after
        the day to day running of the society. Without the tremendous dedication
        of these people, the society would not be able to function! WSC is
        always looking for new people who are willing to offer their help and
        get involved with the society. We divide into 5 teams which you can get
        involved with:
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these teams has different roles available, plus the head of the
        team sits on the Exec. Of course, getting involved in one area of the
        society need not limit you to that role - you can volunteer in several
        different aspects of the society if you wish, so long as you can find
        the time!
      </p>

      <h3>Free Films, you say?</h3>

      <p>
        As an active crew member of the society you and one guest can attend any
        standard screening for FREE!
      </p>

      <p>
        The skills you obtain by being involved with the largest society on
        campus also look impressive to potential future employers, and help you
        to answer no end of interview questions. Plus, WSC tries to maintain an
        interesting and active social life including holding our own special
        events, going to see films, bowling, meals, laser quest, the pub,
        parties, BBQs and much more, new suggestions are always welcomed!
