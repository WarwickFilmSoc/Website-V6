        The publicity team are responsible for spreading the good word about WSC
        in attempt to make more people aware of our great service and
        programming and, ultimately, fill more seats at our screenings.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several ways to get involved with producing and distributing
        publicity:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Writing film reviews</b> that will be printed in our termly
          programme booklet and posted on our website for all to read. This is
          an especially exciting opportunity for budding journalists to
          contribute their work to an award-winning publication, or indeed for
          the casual film lover who would like to offer their slant on
          Hollywood's latest.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Image and title acquisition</b> is a fairly easy way to help out,
          simply involving finding quality graphics of each film's title and
          some images from the film itself for use in our booklets and posters.
          Aesthetics are a key feature in any form of successful marketing, and
          a decent variety of eye-catching graphics help set WSC apart from the
          rest.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Editing</b> the booklet is a fun way to get a bit creative:
          designing page layouts using the review, title and image for each film
          to achieve a high quality level of presentation makes for rewarding
          work, especially when it is published on the printed page.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Designing</b> weekly posters and fliers lets people know what's
          coming soon to WSC in order to keep the masses informed and
          interested.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Distributing</b> publicity is essential to getting WSC noticed
          above all the other activity on campus. We need volunteers to take our
          publicity to residence kitchens around campus, as well as attacking
          departmental noticeboards with a staple gun!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can do as much or as little as you like, and your efforts will be
        rewarded with free tickets to our screenings, the opportunity to make
        friends and have fun at socials, and of course the satisfaction of
        seeing your work in all its glossy glory!{' '}
